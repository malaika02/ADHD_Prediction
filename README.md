# ADHD Classification Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on the classification of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing of medical and demographic data, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple features including behavioral and clinical indicators. Key steps include:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Balancing data using SMOTE

## 🛠️ Preprocessing
Null values were checked and handled

Label encoding for categorical variables

Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

SMOTE applied for class imbalance

## 📊 Feature Selection
Feature importance extracted using ExtraTreesClassifier

Top features selected based on their contribution

## 🧠 Models Used
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results
Performance metrics were compared across models using tabular summaries and visualizations to determine the best-performing algorithm
